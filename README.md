### Front panel

The manufacturing files of the front panel can be found in the [hardware/FrontPanel](hardware/FrontPanel) folder. have been made to cnc machine and laser engrave a front panel. They can also be easily converted to make the front panel of a PCB which is a cheaper option.
The Front panel is composed of the following files:
